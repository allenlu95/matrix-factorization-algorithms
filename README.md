# matrix-factorization-algorithms
In data analysis problems, specifically image recognition problems, different low-rank approximation algorithms play a huge part in computational speed and accuracy.
The following code tests randomized algorithms for matrix factorization based on the following research paper http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.4061v2.pdf
